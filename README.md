Status
===

As of Jan 2, 2004, The two stage document graph model is completed.  

- the ui should be built from both node based partial template structures and point modules
- ~~traverser is still not done~~
- requires a window management layer to view the rendered document
  - necessary refactor for the gfx layer to further abstract the coupling of the node pointer from the node itself
