Document Management Template POET
===
Linked document graph framework for managing complex templates modularly.  The templars toolkit.

The DMT POET provides a method to model, edit, evaluate and compare grouped variables. This is accomplished by creating a graph model from a system of phrases delineating executable context and the data itâ€™s bound within, editable within the api or patch editor environment. This simplifies the management of complex business logic using the poetic vector interface. The resultant is the generation of organized parseable generic documents (json/xml/csv/html/css/text/etc).

Status
===

As of Jan 2, 2004, The two stage document graph model is completed.  

- the ui should be built from both node based partial template structures and point modules
- ~~traverser is still not done~~
- requires a window management layer to view the rendered document
  - necessary refactor for the gfx layer to further abstract the coupling of the node pointers from the visualization
