Document Management Template POET
===
Linked document graph framework for managing complex templates modularly.

The DMT POET system provides a method to generate documents using tools to model, edit, evaluate and compare grouped variables. This is accomplished by creating a graph model from sets of phrases simplifying the management of complex business logic using the poetic vector interface.

Status
===

As of Jan 2, 2004, The two stage document graph model is completed.  

- the ui should be built from both node based partial template structures and point modules
- ~~traverser is still not done~~
- requires a window management layer to view the rendered document
  - necessary refactor for the gfx layer to further abstract the coupling of the node pointers from the visualization
