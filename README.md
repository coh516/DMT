Status
===

As of Jan 2, 2014, The two stage document graph model is completed.  

- the ui should be built from both node based partial template structures and point modules
- needs a simplified selector object interface 
- ~~traverser is still not done~~
- ~~requires a window management layer to view the rendered document~~
  - ~~necessary refactor for the gfx layer to further abstract the coupling of the node pointer from the node itself~~
    - ~~removed universe, graphs are id'd and graphics are now typed~~
    - graphs should be typed also
